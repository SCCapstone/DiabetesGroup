    <h2>Inputting Glucose Logs</h2>
    <p>The AahaRx application's main focus is the glucose levels of Diabetes patients. Here the patient can input their daily glucose levels which will display in the form of a graph once enough data has been added. Patients can also edit/remove glucose levels from the homepage in the glucose log table at the bottom</p>

    <h2>Accessing your Patient List</h2>
    <p>Each nutritionist account has a unique set of patient accounts linked to them. This is so that each nutritionist is able to link and easily access their patient's diet, glucose, and medication logs. Patients can be added to a nutritionist's list by having the nutritionist enter their email and adding them.</p>
