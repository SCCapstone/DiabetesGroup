# DiabetesGroup
DiabetesGroup is working on an app for Diabetes patients as well as their doctors and nutritionists.

### To run the app:
(We assume you have installed WebStorm, Node, and have set up your environment variables. These steps can be found at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/ & https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ )
 1. Clone the project from github
 2. Open the cloned directory in WebStorm (can skip this step if you DO NOT want to view the source code)
 3. Open an Android emulator or connect a device via USB that allows developer options
 4. Open your favorite command line window and go to the directory 
 5. In the command line run the command "npm install"
 6. After the previous command is done, run the command "react-native run-android"
 7. The application should now be open running on your emulator or USB device
